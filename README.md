This repository has two projects in it:
The first project contains a series of various loops and the logic behind how each one work.
The first loop is a for loop, followed by a for loop with a list, then a while loop.
The last 2 loops are nested loops which are loops inside of another loop.
The first nested loop is a while loop, then the last loop uses a for loop that loops a list of different work crews. 

The second project contains numerous if/else conditional statements, with a double elif statement with the and/or logical operators
